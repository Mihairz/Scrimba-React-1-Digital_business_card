## Digital Business Card
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>

Scrimba's immersive frontend course guides learners through key concepts, with solo projects after each section.<br> 
This is the __inital section's final project__, that focused on teaching about *__React components__*. <br>
Therefore, __Digital Business Card__ showcases a static web page made mostly with HTML and CSS but organised and rendered as React components.
